    <h1>a bike</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jan and I am trying to help my friend Chris.</p>
    <p>I like bikes.</p>
    <p>Chris likes AR stuff like this <a href="./sneaker.reality">sneaker</a>, ideally if it comes with the right mime type, once xhris finds out which one it is!</p>
    <p>How about this <a href="./lamp.usdz">lamp</a>, will it come with the right mime type - which is model/usd?!</p>
